1.0.0.????
	* Fixed an issue where pressing "No" on the update prompt would do nothing.
	* Fixed an issue where the ETA for "finalising commander data" would always be 00s.
	* Minor memory optimisations when loading commander data.
	* Fixed an issue where, when given a large number of results, the system search window would fail to populate the results list (or would do so *very* slowly).
	* Fixed an issue causing Elite Monitor's main window to "flash" when the system search window was closed.
	* Scan-related notifications now remain on screen longer to allow more time to read the information displayed (20s vs 10s).
	* Forget what the ending criteria for an Expedition is? Hover over the "ACTIVE" text and it'll tell you now.
	* Expedition Viewer now only allows one instance.
	* The First Discovery window is now treated as a modal dialog.
	* Fixed a crash that would occur when Elite Monitor was loading on a system that had no journal files.
	* Elite Monitor will now automatically create the folder structure for where journal files are stored if it does not exist already to prevent crashing.
	* The grid which displays journal entries on the main window will no longer permanently have a blank row at the bottom.
	* Elite Monitor will no longer display the distance to your home system if you're in your home system.
	* Notifications now correctly obey their display times instead of being 25-30% less.
	* Expeditions will now display notifications when they complete.
	* Fixed an issue where accepting a friend request would show that commander as online, even if they weren't.
	* Added support for the "NavBeaconScan" event.
	* Elite Monitor will no longer play sounds or display notifications for body scans that are the result of scanning a Nav Beacon. They will also not count towards Expeditions.
	* Fixed a typo in the text for the "Bounty" event.
	* Fixed an issue where the status of the currently loaded Expedition in the Expedition Viewer would not update upon completion.
	* Added a "back to top" button on the main event list.
	* Journal search! Search through your journal entries to easily find the one(s) you want! Double- or right-click to jump to that entry in the main list!
	* Added support for the "Materials", "EngineerCraft", "EngineerProgress" and "EngineerApply" events (finally).
		* The blueprint names for the engineer events currently don't have "real" names, and use the internal name for that blueprint instead for now.
	* Elite Monitor's database now has real names for many of Elite's commodities, data and materials, though some are still not known. If you find these, let me know their real names!
	* Removed the "Rescan first discoveries" button from the discovered bodies list as it was always disabled and had no purpose.
	* Fixed some instances where changes were made to commanders, but they weren't correctly marked as dirty (requiring save).
	* Fixed an issue where after reloading Elite Monitor the in-game name of the Commander's current ship would show its internal name instead of its real one.
	* Materials List window has been added. Check your material counts any time, anywhere!
	* Elite Monitor has an icon now!
