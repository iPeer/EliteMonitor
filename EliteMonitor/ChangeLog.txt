	* Expeditions can now be deleted.
	* EliteMonitor now supports users having multiple active expeditions at once.
	* Line heights have been tweaked slightly on the main journal display to combat some text-wrapping issues.
	* Fixed an issue where the ante/post meridiems were being wrapped on timestamps for locales that use them.
	* Added support for the following events: DatalinkVoucher, DatalinkScan, DockSRV, LaunchSRV and Repair.

	* Notifications: Notifications can be displayed when scanning planets (enabled by default) or when friends come online (disabled by default). Can be disabled under the options menu.
