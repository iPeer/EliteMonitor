1.0.0.????
	* Fixed an issue where pressing "No" on the update prompt would do nothing.
	* Fixed an issue where the ETA for "finalising commander data" would always be 00s.
	* Memory optimisations when loading commander data.
	* Fixed an issue where, when given a large number of results, the system search window would fail to populate the results list (or would do so *very* slowly).
	* Fixed an issue causing Elite Monitor's main window to "flash" when the system search window was closed.
	* Scan-related notifications now remain on screen longer to allow more time to read the information displayed (20s vs 10s).
	* Forget what the ending criteria for an Expedition is? Hover over the "ACTIVE" text and it'll tell you now.
	* Expedition Viewer now only allows one instance.
	* The First Discovery window is now treated as a modal dialog.
	* Fixed a crash that would occur when Elite Monitor was loading on a system that had no journal files.
	* Elite Monitor will now automatically create the folder structure for where journal files are stored if it does not exist already to prevent crashing.
	* The grid which displays journal entries on the main window will no longer permanently have a blank row at the bottom.
	* Elite Monitor will no longer display the distance to your home system if you're in your home system.
	* Notifications now correctly obey their display times instead of being 25-30% less.

	* ChangeLog added, we're in 2017 now!

	* Fixed a crash when scanning asteroid belts with the DSS while having an active expedition.

	* Expeditions can now be deleted.
	* EliteMonitor now supports users having multiple active expeditions at once.
	* Line heights have been tweaked slightly on the main journal display to combat some text-wrapping issues.
	* Fixed an issue where the ante/post meridiems were being wrapped on timestamps for locales that use them.
	* Added support for the following events: DatalinkVoucher, DatalinkScan, DockSRV, LaunchSRV and Repair.

	* Fixed an issue causing the previously active commander to not be marked as dirty (requiring save) when switching to a different commander.
	* Fixed several issues with parsing Scan entries from 2.3.* beta journals.
	* Notifications: Notifications can be displayed when scanning planets (enabled by default) or when friends come online (disabled by default). Can be disabled under the options menu.
